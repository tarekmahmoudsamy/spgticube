**About SpgtiCube**
 
SpgtiCube is a novel interlocking set of building cubes (also known as :Toy blocks , building bricks, building blocks, or simply blocks). 
SpgtiCube single piece,  is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square faces and each face has two holes.
Spaghetti sticks are inserted in the holes and used to connect two Individual SpgtiCubes.
A single SpgtiCube can be connected to 6 other SpgtiCubes each on a face.
SpgtiCube works with the commonly available spaghetti. spaghetti is Easy to cut and divide.
SpgtiCubes and spaghetti sticks are used to make sophisticated 3D structures that can not be made using conventional building cubes.

SpgtiCube was prototyped by 3D Printing but it can be manufactured using different materials (for example, and not as a limitation) such as plastic, foamand paper materials.
SpgtiCube can have a range of dimensions changes according to the used materials and the required tolerance to fit the spaghetti in the cube. Original design of SpgtiCube was 1〖cm〗^3 and the 3D Printed prototype was 1.2〖cm〗^3.
Spaghetti is considered as a sustainable source of connecting sticks for SpgtiCube.
Various materials can be used as an alternative to spaghetti to have more strength and durability for SpgtiCube structures. Spaghetti alternatives can be distributed with the SpgtiCube package.
